<p>An online and offline collective for the chipmusic scene.</p><p>&micro;Collective (Micro Collective) was built in the legacy of 8bitcollective, to help support the Chipmusic Community.</p><p>It is currently my largest project to date and, with generous help, have taken it to various chipmusic events around the UK including SuperByte 2013 and 2014 to sell merchandise designed and voted for by the community to help cover site costs! ÂµC was developed ground-up, no frameworks were used.</p><p>We plan to redesign the website to bring new life and functionality, but with only one developer this may not happen in the near future.<br>However, we will continue to run events online and offline!</p><p><a class=pure-button href=https://ucollective.org/ target=_blank><i class='fa fa-globe fa-lg'></i> Live Site</a></p>
