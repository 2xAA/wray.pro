<p>A Twitter bot.</p><p>I wanted to break into Python and interfacing with APIs, so I built a Twitter bot. This particular Twitter bot retweets any tweet with the hashtag &#39;chiptune&#39;.</p><p>It will not retweet replies, retweets, any of the same tweet twice and also any posts by @VGM_bot. This account was created after @_chiptune and retweets prefixing &#39;RT&#39; instead of calling the retweet request, so caused my bot to retweet all of @VGM_bot&#39;s tweets.</p><p>@_chiptune runs on the same Raspberry Pi that updates <a href=/howHot>How Hot is my Pi?</a>.</p><p><a class=pure-button href=https://twitter.com/_chiptune target=_blank><i class='fa fa-circle-o-notch fa-lg'></i> Live account</a></p>
