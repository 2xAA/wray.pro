<p>
	2xAA is my longest running project, commencing in 2007.</p>
  
<p>
  Primarily, music by 2xAA is written with one Nintendo Game Boy. Earlier works use the original 1989 brick, whereas most tracks since 2016 use the more powerful Game Boy Advance. 
</p>
<p>
  My music has been toured internationally with my earliest tour being 3 dates in Russia.
