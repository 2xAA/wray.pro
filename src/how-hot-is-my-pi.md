<p>
	How Hot is my Pi was the result of a free domain name and hosting provided by my University Course.
</p>
<p>
	It displays how hot my Raspberry Pi is every 30 seconds using a bash script with FTP running on my RPi and a little PHP+jQuery on the site itself.
</p>
<p>
	As the free domain and hosting have run their course, I have had to move the site to the new domain "howbakedismypi.com" instead as, like omfg.cat, the domain name is now far out of my price-range to re-register.
