<p>
	AIRHORN.mp3 started out as a joke in a group chat. It now has over 11,000 weekly users.
</p>
<p>
	Its sole purpose is to play the famous Airhorn sample when clicked, nothing more.
</p>
<h5>Trivia</h5>
<p>
	The Airhorn sample was used in early Hip-Hop in the 1980s. Though according to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/2xefeg/where_did_this_airhorn_sound_start/" target="_blank">this Reddit post</a>, it may have even been around since the 1970s, or a similar sample to the same effect.<br>
	<br>
	It is only in the past few years that DJs and producers have given new life to this sample and by doing so have turned it into a popular meme, now adopted by the MLG community. This has attibuted to the success of this Chrome Extension.
