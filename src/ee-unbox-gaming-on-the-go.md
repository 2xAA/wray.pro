<p>Unbox Gaming on the Go was a WebAR experience which rolled out across EE's 600 stores in the UK.</p>

<p>
EE launched their exclusive new gaming-on-the-go offer with this nationwide campaign and wanted a digital in-store activation to support it. Working with publicis•poke, we thought a literal unboxing using WebAR would be an impactful showcase of EE's gaming offering.
</p>

<p>
Over 6 weeks we storyboarded, created and colour-matched 3D assets to EE's brand colours, developed the application using Vue.js, A-Frame and Zappar, and finally optimised the experience for older and less-powerful devices.
