<p>
	A Twitter bot.
</p>
<p>
	I wanted to break into Python and interfacing with APIs, so I built a Twitter bot. This particular Twitter bot retweets any tweet with the hashtag 'chiptune'.
</p>
<p>
	It will not retweet replies, retweets, any of the same tweet twice and also any posts by @VGM_bot. This account was created after @_chiptune and retweets prefixing 'RT' instead of calling the retweet request, so caused my bot to retweet all of @VGM_bot's tweets.
</p>
<p>
	@_chiptune runs on the same Raspberry Pi that updates <a href="/howHot">How Hot is my Pi?</a>.
