modV is an open-source music visualisation application, akin to softwares such as Resolume.
Work towards modV is ongoing and contributions are welcome.

The project was started after seeing the work of [Dario Villanueva](http://www.alolo.co).

modV's origin stems from a crowd controlled music visualiser built within a week at YRS2014 for the Saturday night show I was organising. The premice was to allow people to be involved in the show, even if they weren't up for dancing.

A rewrite to use Vue.JS was initiated at the end of 2017, since then modV has had many features added, such as:

* Plugins
* Contextual Menus
* LFOs
* [Interactive Shader Format](https://www.interactiveshaderformat.com/) support
* MIDI assignments
* DMX lighting control (via [Luminave](https://github.com/NERDDISCO/luminave))
