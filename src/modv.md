JavaScript based realtime music visualisation.

modV is an open-source music visualisation application, akin to softwares such as Resolume.
The project is ongoing and contributions are welcome.

modV was inspired after creating crowd controlled music visuals at YRS2014.

During the week, I created visuals for the Saturday night gig I had organised. From playing the gig in 2013 I knew a lot of people weren't going to dance, but I wanted people to still be involved, so I created the crowd controlled visuals which you could control from a smartphone whilst listening to the music and seeing, projected on stage, the affect of your actions along with the music.
