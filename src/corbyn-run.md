Excerpt from CorbynRun.com:

This is a game about building a movement, about realising our own power to change this election - to rebuild and transform Britain For The Many, Not The Few.

In CorbynRun you play as Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn taking money back from Theresa Mayhem and her army of tax dodgers and Tories. Gather People Power, launch Labour manifesto pledges, defeat the Tories.

CorbynRun was created by a group of 9 Labour-supporting game designers, developers, activists, musicians and artists keen on contributing to the Labour campaign. We're an international team too, including Spanish and Italians, who've lived in the UK for years but can't vote - but wanted to make an input into the election of a Labour government.
